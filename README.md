# Stanford CS231N CNN for Visual Recognition
Solution to 2016 & 2017 Course Assignments


## Assignment 1 - Put Together Image Classification

- construct the basic Image Classification pipeline
- understand split train/val/test splits and the use of validation data for hyperparameter tuning
- develop proficiency in writing efficient vectorized code with numpy
- implement a [k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifier](assignment1/knn.ipynb)
- implement a [Multiclass Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier](assignment1/svm.ipynb)
- implement a [Softmax classifier](assignment1/softmax.ipynb)
- implement a [Two layer neural network classifier](assignment1/two_layer_net.ipynb)
- understand the differences and tradeoffs between these classifiers
- get a basic understanding of performance improvements from using higher-level representations than raw pixels (e.g. color histograms, Histogram of Gradient (HOG) features)

## Assignment 2 - Train Deep Neural Networks
#### 1. Fully Connected Nets
#### 2. Batch Normalizzation
#### 3. Dropout
#### 4. Convolutional Nets

- understand and implement (vectorized) backpropagation
- implement various update rules used to optimize Neural Networks
- implement batch normalization for training deep networks
- implement dropout to regularize networks
- effectively cross-validate and find the best hyperparameters for Neural Network architecture
- understand the architecture of Convolutional Neural Networks and train gain experience with training these models on data
